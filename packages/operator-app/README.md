# CMNM - Operator App üåê

The Operator App is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web application, which is one part of the Crowdsourced Mobile Network Metrics project.

This web app provides a user interface that allows communication with the cloud functions in the project's [backend service](https://github.com/tamaskr/crowdsourced-network-metrics/tree/main/packages/backend) in order to make queries and visualise data from all the past queries. The raw data is visualised on charts, tables and maps as well.
